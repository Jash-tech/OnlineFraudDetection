    "To identify online payment fraud with machine learning, we need to train a machine learning model for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. For this, we need a dataset containing information about online payment fraud, so that we can understand what type of transactions lead to fraud. For this task, I collected a dataset from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect fraud in online payments. Below are all the columns from the dataset I’m using here:\n",
    "\n",
    "step: represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour\n",
    "type: type of online transaction\n",
    "amount: the amount of the transaction\n",
    "nameOrig: customer starting the transaction\n",
    "oldbalanceOrg: balance before the transaction\n",
    "newbalanceOrig: balance after the transaction\n",
    "nameDest: recipient of the transaction\n",
    "oldbalanceDest: initial balance of recipient before the transaction\n",
    "newbalanceDest: the new balance of recipient after the transaction\n",
    "isFraud: fraud transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you now know about the data I am using for the online payment fraud detection task. Now in the section below, I’ll explain how we can use machine learning to detect online payment fraud using Python."
